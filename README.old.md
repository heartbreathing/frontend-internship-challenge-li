# Revam's Frontend Coding Challenge
Welcome to Revam's coding test for frontend developers. The purpose of this test is to evaluate your skills in React, routing, and styling.

## Time Limit: 4 Hours
You have a maximum of 4 hours to complete this coding challenge. While this should be ample time to complete the required tasks, it also allows you some room to add any optional features, polish your code, or revisit any parts you might want to improve.

## Guidelines
✅ You ARE Allowed To:
- Use Google for searching code snippets or troubleshooting.
- Refer to books or documentation.
- Contact your contact person at Revam for clarification on the test.

❌ You ARE NOT Allowed To:
- Collaborate with anyone else on solving the test.
- Share the code or the test details with anyone outside Revam.
- Use GitHub Copilot.

## Tasks
Your challenge is to build a simple, mobile-first React application with the following features:

- React App: Initialize a new React application from scratch.
- Styling: Use either Material UI (MUI) or TailwindCSS for styling.
- Navbar: Create a navigation bar that allows for routing between pages.
- Routing: Implement 3 different routes - Home, About, and Products.
- API Integration: use axios to GET and render a list of 10 products from our API: https://api.revam.cloud/api/extension/

## Optional: Additional Features
Feel free to add any additional features that you think would improve the application or demonstrate your coding skills. While these are not required, extra features will be considered favorably during the assessment.

## How to Submit
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- For each new feature or task, create a dedicated branch with a descriptive name (e.g., addNavbar, fixApiIntegration, changeProductPage).
- Complete the work for that feature within this new branch.
- After finishing, initiate a pull request (PR) targeting the main branch.
- Review your own code to ensure it meets quality standards and guidelines.
- Merge the PR into main once you're confident in your changes.
- Start a new branch for the next feature or task and repeat the process.

We'll review your submission based on code quality, feature completion, and adherence to the guidelines. Good luck!
